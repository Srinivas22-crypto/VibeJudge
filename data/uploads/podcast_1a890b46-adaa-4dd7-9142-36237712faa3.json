  "text": " How does India look like from space? Looking at India in the daytime, colors are amazing. The Himalayas are absolutely amazing. As you can see, when the rivers run off, how they interact. Night, India is pretty spectacular. The cities are lit up and all those lights seem to be connected. Sunita Williams and Butch Wilmo are still stuck in space and are not expected to return. Ten-day test flight turned into a nine-month-long mission in space. This after their Boeing Starliner face roster failed. This time, this flight, the last one was pretty messed up. Once after we launched and then we got to the space station, we knew we weren't going to come home as planned. We knew it would be six more months. When you're in space and coming home, this byproduct of this business, it's risky. How many situations do you plan for? Oh gosh, hundreds. Train for two years for a launch of a spacecraft. Because we go through with our control team, hey, what if this failed? What if that failed? And what's the probability of this and that happening? Was there any point where you heard some sound and you got scared? We were all a little on edge. One in this latest flight, when we had a satellite below us in orbit explode, and then there was a bit of a debris field. And so we were woken up in the middle of the night to all go to our own spacecraft. It's called Safe Haven. And we all sort of hugged each other. Hopefully I'll see you on Earth. Did you feel lonely in one of those 286 days? People that you end up living in space, they become family. Have you cried in space? Oh, absolutely. Absolutely. I miss people and I miss my dog. So of course I cried. What was the most difficult part for you of the training? Like if I have to just go do something, it doesn't bother me. I've trained, I've done it like spacewalk stuff, robotic stuff doesn't make me nervous. But academics in college were hard for me. Before you set a foot on your first flight, you saw what happened with Kalpana Chawla. She's a friend of yours, she's a role model, and you saw her death. This day has brought terrible news and great sadness to our country. The Columbia's lost. There are no survivors. Did that event change anything you? I think the desire to explore more. I think it gave us even more of a feeling of like we really want to continue this. We've got to do this in their memory. We're not going to let their situation put a stop on it. They wouldn't want that. So we're going to press harder. What's the health cost you pay when you come back? For me, I always feel a little nauseous when I come back. The neurovestibular system has not been working. While you're up in space, it's sort of like a new experience. You have shut down and you have other feelings of orientation while you're up there. For me, I felt pretty nauseous for like 24 hours. Do you believe there's some life out there? Absolutely. With those billions of stars out there, we're just a little planet around one star. So yeah, there's life out there. How does space smell like? Tell me about your biggest insecurity. What's the strangest thing you've seen in the space which you think is going to be hard to believe for people here? Interesting. Before starting today's episode, I have a small request. The whole team and I are working very hard to bring bigger and bigger guests for you so that we can give you more value and learnings through better conversations. And to continue doing that, I need you to subscribe our channel. It's free and takes only two seconds. And we promise that if you do this, we'll keep bringing the top 1% guest from all around the world and make you prouder one day. Our today's guest has done nine space walks, spent more than 62 hours walking in space, more than any other woman in human history. Very few women get to lead the International Space Station and she's not just commanded the ISS once but twice. She has been part of three epic ISS missions, spent 608 days in space, the second most of any NASA astronaut ever. I'm talking about Sunita Williams, the woman who's flown 40 different aircraft, served as a Navy captain and is also the first human being ever to have run a marathon in space. And just last year, she was stranded in space for nine months when her spacecraft failed. The whole world washed, but she didn't panic, she took the charge. And in this conversation, we'll figure out the training, the mindset, the sacrifices it took to become one of the greatest female astronauts in the world and what does it take to build a mindset where you can become when everything is going against you? I'm just really, really honored to do this. I just wanted you to know this. Well, thank you.",
